New flight plans can be created with an unique name (e.g., "Tour Flight - The Keys"), and by creating a new flight plan, all previous results are cleaned for a new fresh start.
You can do this with the ``Create!`` button. If you want to overwrite an existing flightplans, use the toggle ``overwrite`` to overwrie existing flight plans with the same name.


Load/ Delete Flight Plan
**************************

The second expnder contains the ``Load Flight Plan!`` button and the ``Delete Flight Plan`` button.
The load button is to load previously saved flight plans. This can be helpful to look back how the details were of a previous flight. But it can also be used to load all the details and make adjustments for a new similar flight.
Notably, deleting the flight plan means that is deleted from the database and can not be recovered anymore!
